public enum FCMAndroidMessagePriority: String, Codable {
    ///Default priority for data messages. Normal priority messages won't open network connections on a sleeping device, and their delivery may be delayed to conserve the battery. For less time-sensitive messages, such as notifications of new email or other data to sync, choose normal delivery priority.

    ///Default priority for notification messages. FCM attempts to deliver high priority messages immediately, allowing the FCM service to wake a sleeping device when possible and open a network connection to your app server. Apps with instant messaging, chat, or voice call alerts, for example, generally need to open a network connection and make sure FCM delivers the message to the device without delay. Set high priority if the message is time-critical and requires the user's immediate interaction, but beware that setting your messages to high priority contributes more to battery drain compared with normal priority messages.
